# ü§ñ Robotics Control GUI & HMI Interface

**A Human-Machine Interface (HMI) and Game-Based Control System for a Robotic Hand named Handy.**

## üéØ Project Goal

To develop a user-friendly and robust control interface for a robotic hand, enabling both direct assistive **mimicry functionality** and engaging **game-based interaction** (Rock, Paper, Scissors). This project serves as a foundational platform for future assistive and interactive robotics development.

## üóù Key Features & Functionality (My Contribution)

The High-Level Interface (HMI) was developed entirely in Python, utilizing the **Kivy** and **KivyMD** frameworks for a modern, cross-platform design.

* **Custom HMI Development:** Engineered a full-screen, user-centric GUI across two primary screens, allowing for intuitive control and display of real-time camera feed.
* **Asynchronous Command Thread:** Designed and implemented the main application logic to manage the UI thread independently from the command thread, ensuring the interface remains responsive while sending commands to the robotic system.
* **Game State Management:** Developed the complete logic for the three-round **Rock, Paper, Scissors game**, including a custom **color-changing countdown widget** and an interactive **scoreboard** to track results.
* **Gesture Trigger Interfacing:** Created the command calls from the UI that securely activate the external gesture recognition module (`gestures.py`) to execute specific hand movements.
